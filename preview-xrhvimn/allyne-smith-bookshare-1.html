                If you’re here because someone gave you this book, I’d like you to know who it belonged to:
                an extraordinary person named Allyne, whom I lovingly called “Father Lev.”
                While I don’t know if he had a chance to finish reading the book before (what he dubbed as) having “reposed” (<a
                    href="https://www.caldwellparrish.com/obituaries/allyne-smith-jr#:~:text=PLANT%20TREES-,VIDEOS,-Allyne%20Levoit%20Smith"
                    target="_blank">his memorial page →</a>), I do know that he would
                want his copy to be shared freely; and also that he as a priest, theologian, and philosopher
                would recommend your reading it! Allyne had an extensive library, and his family
                bestowed me and others many boxfuls of his books.
            </p>

            <p>
                In eternal memory of the whimsical Allyne, let’s try something playful. If you’ve received this book,
                whether you decide to read it or not, please pass it along to someone else (even a stranger), with
                instructions to visit this webpage and continue the book’s journey. And then, if you like, please
                drop me a line at sharingallynesbooks@gmail.com, noting your home city or other locale and anything else
                you’d like to share. I’ll be recording the book’s travels <a href="#journey">below</a>
                (but only sharing the information you wish to be shared). If this fun little experiment proves fruitful,
                I’ll have more of Allyne’s books to share in like fashion.
            </p>
